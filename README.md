# Classic Games

This repository contains Python scripts for classic games, including Minesweeper and Tic Tac Toe. The code is relatively short and uses libraries such as Pygame and Tkinter.

## Getting Started

To run any of the games in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed. You can download Python from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You'll also need to install the required libraries for each game. You can do this by running the following command:


## Games

1. Snake Game: a classic game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding obstacles and the snake's own tail. [Link to code](https://github.com/example/snake-game)

2. Tic Tac Toe: a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three in a row. [Link to code](https://github.com/example/tic-tac-toe)

3. Minesweeper: a single-player puzzle game where the player must clear a minefield without detonating any mines. [Link to code](https://github.com/example/minesweeper)

4. Pong: a classic arcade game where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth across the screen. [Link to code](https://github.com/example/pong)

5. Connect Four: a two-player game where each player drops colored disks into a vertical grid, aiming to connect four disks of their color in a row. [Link to code](https://github.com/example/connect-four)

6. Hangman: a single-player game where the player must guess a word by suggesting letters, with a limited number of guesses allowed. [Link to code](https://github.com/example/hangman)

7. Blackjack: a card game where players aim to get a hand with a higher value than the dealer's, without going over 21. [Link to code](https://github.com/example/blackjack)

8. Memory: a card game where the player must match pairs of cards with the same image. [Link to code](https://github.com/example/memory)

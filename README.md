This repository contains a collection of classic games implemented in Python using the Pygame and Tkinter libraries. The code is relatively short and easy to read, making it a great resource for learning the basics of game programming in Python.

The games included in this repository are:

Minesweeper
Tetris
Snake
Pong
Each game has its own directory, which contains a Python script and any necessary assets. The code is well-commented and organized, making it easy to understand and modify.

To run a game, simply navigate to its directory and run the corresponding Python script. For example, to play Minesweeper, navigate to the minesweeper directory and run the minesweeper.py script.
